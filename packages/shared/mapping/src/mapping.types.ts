/**
 * @soopa/mapping — Shared types for the Standard Execution Engine.
 *
 * These types are the contract between:
 *  - The API (which stores mapping expressions in field_mapping table)
 *  - The UI canvas (which produces MappingRule[] from field connections + formula picker)
 *  - The Worker FanOutService (which calls MappingEngine.build())
 *
 * ## How JSONata fits in
 *
 * The `expression` field in `MappingRule` is a JSONata expression string.
 * JSONata is evaluated at runtime against the full Canonical Composite JSON.
 * The user NEVER writes JSONata — the canvas formula picker generates it.
 *
 * Formula picker → JSONata expression (invisible to user):
 *   "Date Format (DD/MM/YYYY)"  → $fromMillis($toMillis(invoiceDate), '[D01]/[M01]/[Y0001]')
 *   "Uppercase"                 → $uppercase(Account.Name)
 *   "Concatenate"               → firstName & ' ' & lastName
 *   "Round (2dp)"               → $round(amount, 2)
 *
 * See: https://docs.jsonata.org/simple for the full function reference.

 * Produced by the Mapping Canvas and stored in the field_mapping table (one row per rule).
 *
 * Simple copy (no expression):
 *   { srcPath: 'Account.TaxId', destPath: 'VendorRef.TaxIdentifier' }
 *   → extracts compositeJson.Account.TaxId and writes to payload.VendorRef.TaxIdentifier
 *
 * JSONata transform:
 *   { srcPath: 'invoiceDate', destPath: 'TxnDate',
 *     expression: "$fromMillis($toMillis(invoiceDate), '[D01]/[M01]/[Y0001]')" }
 *   → evaluates the expression against the full compositeJson, writes result to TxnDate
 *   → srcPath is used by the UI only (to show which source field is "connected")
 *
 * Multi-source expression (srcPath is UI-only metadata):
 *   { srcPath: 'firstName', destPath: 'DisplayName',
 *     expression: "firstName & ' ' & lastName" }
